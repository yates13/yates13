Hi, I’m Shawn Yates.

I’m interested in computational biology, bioinformatics, and leveraging technology to solve biological problems.

Currently, I’m learning various coding languages and tools such as RStudio, Python, shell scripting, and SAS to enhance my skills in genomic data analysis.

I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to genomics, transcriptomics, and other areas of computational biology.

You can reach me at sdy0002@auburn.edu.
